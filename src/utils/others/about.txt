Our Mission
“To always help our Customers find Moments of Happiness and Satisfaction by delivering superior bakery products and services that exceed their expectations.”

I’ve tasted Bake and ice before on 2 or 3 different occasions, and each time they were really nice. So I decided to try them out for myself. From the customer service (which was excellent, by the way) to the delivery, everything went really well (minus one small flavor detail which was easy to overlook).
